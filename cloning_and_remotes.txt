Cloning copies an existing repo. Copied entirely, including version history. 
Keeps track of the repo remotes.

$ git clone git@github.com:<username>/<repo>.git
will make a copy in directory. No need to mkdir the directory first.

Remote repositories:
Copies of a repo elsewhere, on a network or the 'net.
Allows collaboration.
Remotes can be added or removed when needed.

	1/ clone the repo.
	2/ git remote = shows which remotes we are using.
	3/ origin is the default remote.
	4/ A new remote can be added with a new remote.
	5/ git remote add <shortname> <url>
	6/ We can update our local repo with files from the original remote or our new remote.
	7/ git fetch origin or <name>

This fetch is NOT merged!!
	8/ git merge origin/master master or git merge <name>/master master
This will merge the remote AFTER it's been fetched!

Push will push changes to remote.
Always use git status first. Then:

$ git push <name of remote, eg:>origin <name of branch, eg:>master

	9/ git remote show origin <shortname>
	Shows the remote origin, including Fetch and Push URLs.
	10/ git pull - an alias for git fetch && git merge origin master
